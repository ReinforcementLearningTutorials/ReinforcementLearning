# Welcome to my Personal RL Projects Repo
Although I'm an embedded software engineer by day, I have a significant interest in reinforcement learning. I have decided to build a portfolio of RL projects to further my personal development. I recently finished my master's at Georgia Tech, but I want to continue challenging myself as to keep things interesting.

# RL Methods
- Monte Carlo Prediction and Action Selection
  - Blackjack (OpenAI Gym) "Example from Sutton and Barto example 5.1"
- Value Iteration
  - FrozenLake 4x4 and 8x8 (OpenAI Gym)

# Resources
I will mainly be using OpenAI Gym environments until I finish them. Then I'll make my own interesting ones. OpenAI Gym Link: https://gym.openai.com/

The main book I reference is Sutton and Barto: http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html
